## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Initial Rust workspace for the Brim toolchain.
- Language specification draft for Brim 0.1 (edition 2026), with an EBNF grammar.
- Lexer with UTF-8 spans, string escapes, integer literals, reserved keywords and error recovery.
- Recursive-descent parser with precedence climbing, newline-terminated statements, error recovery and a nesting limit.
- Semantic analysis: scopes, function table, type checking for `i64`, `bool`, `string` and `void`, entry-point validation, typo suggestions and warnings.
- Diagnostics system with error codes, labels, notes, help and colored rendering.
- Brim IR with a text form and validator, and lowering from the checked program.
- Reference interpreter with checked integer arithmetic and located run-time errors.
- Native backend interface (`brim-codegen`). The LLVM backend is not implemented, and `brim build` reports it as unavailable.
- Runtime ABI definition and builtin catalogue (`print`).
- `brim.toml` manifest parsing and validation.
- `brim` CLI: `check` (with `--emit tokens|ast|ir`), `run`, `build`, `help`, `version`.
- Examples, fixture-based test suites, and CI for formatting, linting and tests on Linux, macOS and Windows.
